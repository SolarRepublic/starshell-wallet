# Terminology

Throughout this codebase, there are repeated uses of original names for concepts, interfaces and other abstractions. To get familiar with the source code comments, function/class names, file names, and variable identifiers, it helps to have a reference for some of the major recurring terms.


### Motivation

One particular challenge that motivated the more deliberate namings of things was the integration with the TypeScript types and methods generated by the Cosmos-SDK (and chain-specific) protobuf packages.

For example, `Event` and `Log` have specific meanings in Cosmos-SDK. For the wallet's activity log, it would have been very confusing to also use these terms. Therefore, `Incident` was chosen to represent the record-keeping unit item in the wallet.
