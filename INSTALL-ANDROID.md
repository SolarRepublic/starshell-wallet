# StarShell Beta: Getting Started for Android

**System Requirements:**
 - Android 12 or later

### Choose a browser

Android users have a few options as to which browser to use:

 - [Mull](#mull-browser) - üèÜ Recommended choice. Best UX, best privacy, but most involved setup
 - [Firefox Nightly](#firefox-nightly-browser) - üî™ Less setup than Mull, but unknown stability and security
 - [Kiwi](#kiwi) - üçº Easiest setup and stable, but worst privacy


## Mull Browser

Mull is a privacy-oriented browser based on Firefox that removes Mozilla telemetry and allows add-ons.

A video tutorial of the setup process is documented here:
